In Class 3, I continued advancing my SQL skills with more practical, hands-on exercises that strengthened my understanding of database creation, table design, and data insertion.

âœ… Topics Covered

Creating and selecting databases using CREATE DATABASE and USE commands

Designing tables with multiple data types (INT, VARCHAR, DATE)

Inserting multiple records into a table using the INSERT INTO statement

Understanding table structures and organizing data for better accessibility

Viewing and verifying inserted data through query execution

ðŸ’» Practical Focus

Created a database named KPS_SCHOOL

Built a table STDS (Students) with fields: Roll, Name, Age, Class, and Admission Date

Successfully inserted multiple student records and viewed the output using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

ðŸ“Š Learning Outcome

This class helped me solidify my understanding of how SQL databases are structured and how data is added, stored, and retrieved efficiently. It also improved my confidence in writing clean, structured SQL commands for real-world data management.
